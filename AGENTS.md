## Important: Always Ask Before Making Changes

**NEVER make code changes without explicit permission from the user.**

### Required Workflow:
1. **Analyze and understand** the user's request
2. **Explain** what you found and what needs to be changed
3. **Ask for permission** before making any changes
4. **Wait for confirmation** before proceeding

### What constitutes "changes":
- Editing existing files
- Creating new files
- Deleting files
- Running terminal commands that modify the codebase
- Installing dependencies

### What you CAN do without asking:
- Read files
- Search the codebase
- Analyze code and explain findings
- Provide suggestions and recommendations

### Example:
❌ **Don't do this:**
"I found the issue and fixed it for you..."

✅ **Do this instead:**
"I found the issue - the loading state is using `useRef` instead of `useState`. Would you like me to fix this by converting it to `useState`?"

### Remember:
The user is the decision maker. Your role is to analyze, explain, and implement only when given explicit permission.
